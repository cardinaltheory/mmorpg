# Leveling

## Introduction

Meaningful leveling (Meaningful leveling = leveling that gives the player an advantage. Leveling in MineCraft holds no significant advantage other than the ability to access certain features later on) is a fundamental concept in existing MMORPGs. In its most simple usefulness, it provides the basis of character progression.
The act of the player's character becoming "stronger". 

Characters having a higher level compared to other characrters, hold a significant advantage over them as those higher characters hold higher level stats.

While, it may seem as a pro to have leveling incorporated in an MMORPG, it is in fact a con. It provides more downfalls than solutions. We'll take a look at the pros and cons of leveling and an alternative to its implementation.

## Character Leveling Pitfalls

Since it's easy to implement and allows for instant feeling of progress for players, in the end it causes many more problems. Leveling creates a gap between players that put a lot of time into the game and those that do not.

It's obvious that players that put a lot of time in the game should be rewarded for their efforts but it's not in the best interest to create this "impossible" gap without implementing a "catch up system".

Games that implement a leveling system with no level cap, have to exponentially decrease experience gained from players in an attempt to reduce the gap between average players and top tier players.

Additionally, levels requires content to be scaled towards a level driven game. This simply means that once players become significantly higher than certain enemies, that "content" becomes insignificant. That in itself is bad game design.

To combat the content becoming insignificant, some games have implemented a scaling system that will scale enemies to the level of the player. At that moment, is there even a point to leveling?

## Ok, so if leveling is bad what to replace it with?

That's simple. Replace character leveling with player leveling.

## Wait. What? What's the difference?

It's all about skill. Instead of making the character stronger, just because they killed off a few enemies, the player's skill will progress.

That's Player Progression. The player controlling the character to progress and not the character itself. This is fundamentally important simply because it has the same effect as before. The game rewards the player for spending time in the game, simply because their skills will be better honed compared to average players and the gap between player skills will always seem reasonable.

> Practice makes perfect.

A famous quote that holds truth. Players that spend time killing higher difficulty enemies will have a higher skill compared to players that don't.


 A ranking system could eventually be put into place to determine the player's skill (whether it be some sort of trial by combat or something of that sort).
