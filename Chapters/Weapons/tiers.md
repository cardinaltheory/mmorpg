# Weapon Tiers

Weapons should have different tiers. Each tier will have a hard cap on how much additional damage it can do.

## Tiers

Possible weapon tiers:

1. Poor
2. Common
3. Uncommon
4. Rare
5. Epic
6. Legendary
7. God

## Durability

Weapons are susceptible to taking damage and need repairs. The lower the weapon tier the faster they lose their durability.

Legendary and God tier weapons should not take any durability damage.
