# Flying

Flying can often be considered a contreversial topic. It's something that can only be dreamed of and is often frowned upon.

# Pros

1. Gives players a sense of superiority
2. Gives players an overview of the whole world
3. Allows players to travel to and from different places
4. Gives players more freedom

# Cons

1. Zones become less frequented as more people fly around
2. PvP is in a sense "easy to get away from" or "avoided"

# Conclusion

Flying is a great feature but it comes with certain downsides as it ruins other aspects of the game. To balance flying,
a counter feature should be added to not make flying overpowered.

# Counter Feature

1. Make flying skillbased and challenging (turbulent winds, flying enemy NPCs, flying PvP)
2. Allow for anti-flying ground weapons.
