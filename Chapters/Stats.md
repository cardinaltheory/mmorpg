# Stats / Attributes

Stats (also known as attributes) are properties that define how powerful the character being played is.

Some common stats are:

1. HP ( Health Points)
2. Intellect ( Magic pool )
3. Agility
4. Strength

As the player's character earns more stats (either throug leveling, special events, gear, or weapons), the character not only becomes stronger but it provides a way of progression for the player.

That in itself is a good idea, but again like leveling rewards players that spend more time in the game than others. This is game breaking, as a catch up mechanism needs to be implemented to offer a way for other players "to catch up".

If this implementation is not proposed then the gap will become enormous.

Attributes do not provide an advantage to skilled players, but simply rewards players (skilled or unskilled) that spend more time in the game.

The idea is to reward players that have skill. Only specific and logical stats should be awarded.

Attributes should only provide a bonus to defense or to attack power. The rest should be handled by the player.

### Health Points
Health points should be fixed and set to 100%. Depending on armor defense and enemy weapon damage + strength the health should reduce by a certain percentage.

### Intellect
Intellect should be removed.

### Agility
Agility should be determined by player skill and the gear weight.
Strength should be removed.

## Player Attributes

Most of the attributes should be based on the player. How long can the player keep the concentration going? How long can the player keep the combination attacks going? How accurate is blocking? How accurate is dodging? These are all questions that are determined by the player and their skill.

> How should magic casters be handled?

Magic casters cast spells (obviously). Some spells are faster to cast than others.

> Can magic casters cast while moving ?

As mentioned before, this is entirely dependant on the player skill and the difficulty of the game implementation of casting spells. In theory, yes it's possible.
