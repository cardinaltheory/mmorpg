# Dynamic and Inifinte World

## Infinite world

The world is generated from a seed. This means that no two servers are the same. The worlds spam forever in every direction.

## Dynamic World

The world consists of different kinds of terrains and bioms.

The world changes depending on the players actions, on climate, and on cataclysmic level events.

### Player Actions

Player can shape the world by either building villages, cities and metropolises. The player can also change the terrain by boring into mountains or digging into the ground.

Direct player modification of the world becomes exponentially difficult. Also the difficulty also increases depending on the material that is being escavated.

The deeper the player attemps to dig, the harder it gets.
The deeper the player bores the harder it gets.

### Climate

There are multiple climates which should be configured differently depending on nearby sun and planet influence.
