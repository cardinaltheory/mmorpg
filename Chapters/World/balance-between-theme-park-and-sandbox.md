# Balance Between Theme Park and Sandbox MMORPG

We'll first take a look at what  Theme Park and a Sandbox MMORPG are and see why the need of a balance between the two are needed.

## Historical Theme Park

Games have historically been theme park oriented. Which simply means, that the developper controls the user's experience. This can be compared to real life Theme Parks.

From the moment the player enters the game, their experience is dictated and is restricted by what the developper had originally intended.

If the developper has a great vision for where a game should go, then the experience for the player becomes amazing. The initial experience for the player can be extremely profound as they enter a new world hidden behind a storyline full of mystery.

However, once the world has been fully discovered the magic behind the game slowly fades as there is less and less to expect. Developers to combat this, offer expansions with new zones, new quests, and new achievements to conquer. Additionaly, seasonal events to spice it up and offer extra content is often used. This only treats the symptom and not the original problem.

Top MMORPGs that are theme parked offer what is historically known as:

1. Leveling Progression
2. Grinding Progression
3. Achievements
4. Repeatable content

We'll talk more in depth about these specific topics in their respective categories. To give a quick overview regarding this; the previous points are easy ways to make the player feel as if they "progress" however they are the problems that cause the most issues later on.

### Leveling

Leveling offers a progression system that allows the player to see their character advance. While this may have originally been seen as a quick way to offer a feeling of progression, it's the most costly in the end.

A character becomes stronger in the world as they gain higher levels, allowing them to go from one zone to the next and defeat stronger enemies. However, once the player's character reaches a certain level, their reason to come back to previous zones becomes less.

As more and more expansions come out, more and more zones become available and the game becomes truely enormous, many zones become "nullified" in a sense as there is no reason for players to come back to these zones.

As a solution to this problem, some MMORPG's have incorporated something called scaling. Enemies scale to the player's level. However, this still does not give a reason for players to come back to previous zones as the scaling is often limited to a certain extent.

### Grinding

Grinding progression is not a "terrible" game design, but if it becomes the main focus of the game and it's repeatable content then all of a sudden this concept can burn players out.

### Repeatable content

Offering repeatable content to a certain extent is understandable, but if the game is focused primarily on repeatable content then things become stale after a while and nothing new can be expected.

We'll see in later chapters how this can be solved. In general though some content needs to be "exclusive". Lets take quests as a quick example. A quest to farm for pumpkins in a field could be expected to be repeatable, but defeating a named enemy (to the death) would not.

## Sandbox 

The idea behind a Sandbox MMO is that the player decides what they want to do. From the moment they enter the game, the player decides how the world is shaped.

This is powerful as the player can truly use their imagination in whatever way they so choose.

The only downside is that the concept meaningful storyline is often times completely inexistant or just not fully developped. There is no deeper meaning and the mystery behind the world as it came to be is weak.

## Balance Dynamic Theme Park and Sandbox

### What is a Dynamic Theme Park (DTP) ?

DTP is simply an advanced version of a theme park. Think of it as, a real life Theme Park such as Universal Studios or Disney land where the creators (aka developers) had little to no manual work to incorporate content. Think of it as content automatically generated via an AI and that dynamically changes as time goes by.

### And... why would I want such a thing?

The main problem with new content today is that it needs to be manually created. Manual labor is expensive and takes time. If certain parts of this manual labor can be handed to an AI then that means the player can receive what would be called "Continuous Content".

Continuous content is a way to receive new content faster and at undefined intervals. It's unexpected and always adds new things to discover and do.

Imagine being in a world, where new content is added while the player is on their adventure.

### The balance between DTP and Sandbox

The general idea is to provide continuous content to the player while giving them the opportunity to do whatever they so choose within the game.
