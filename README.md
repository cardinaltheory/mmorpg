# Cardinal Theory MMORPG

> Disclaimer: This is currently in the works. A first release is not to be expected anytime soon. Feel free to offer advice regarding this project in the issues section.

## Our Goal

Cardinal Theory aims to solve the lack of innovation within MMORPGs. It's completely hypothetical and does not take into account possible technological limits. The idea is to let ones imagination go free and to see where it can go.

## What is Cardinal Theory ?

Cardinal Theory was inspired by the Sword Art Online Game System called Cardinal. Essentially, an advanced AI driven game engine to offer a mix and a balance between a Theme Park and a Sandbox MMORPG.
